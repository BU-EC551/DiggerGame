There are two levels in our Digger Game. After getting the score over 300, you will go to next levelWhen you are caught up by goblins, a “Game over” will pop up on the screen.At the beginning, a digger is shown on the top-right corner. The player can control the digger by the keyboard (Up-8, down-2, left-4, right-6). There is also a button (BTNR(M17)) used to fire a bullet. Besides, if game is frozen due to some unfixed bugs, reset button is BTNC(N17).Digger is able to dig a hole and can go anywhere it wants, but goblins can only go through empty block.Digger can collect diamonds (5 points for each) and the remainder of moneybags (20 points for each) to get the score. Besides, shooting the goblin (15 points for each) also can obtain score. There are always 3 goblins chasing after the player. The creation of 3 goblins is one by one. If one of them is killed, it will rebirth at the top-left corner. There is a limitation for the speed of bullet. Another bullet will not show up until the previous one disappears. Moneybag will turn to the remainder if it drops more than one layers and will remain the same if dropping only one layer. Moneybag will crush goblins but the digger.If you want to know more details about how to play, please see the video.Tricky skill:Stay right below one moneybag to stop it from falling down and wait, and don’t leave until a goblin approaches; the falling moneybag will crush the goblin.Unsolved Corner Case:These cases all have right simulation result but cause unexpected bugs when running on FPGA board.1.	You cannot run faster than a bullet, or the game will be frozen2.	If your next block is a moneybag, you cannot still run into it, or the game will be frozen.Solved Corner Case:1. When bullet hits the border of the screen, the bullet will disappear correctly. 2. When one goblin dies, it will correctly be reborn from the birth place3. When the moneybag is in gold state, it can be eaten by digger correctly
